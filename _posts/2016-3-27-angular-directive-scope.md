## Content

It seems to me that directive is one of the most powerful and useful concept in Angular. Because I'm a newcomer to Angular, I would like to write down my view about directive's isolated scope.

There are plenty of basics about isolated scope and difference between `@` 、 `=` 、 `&` , so I will not repeat them.

- [What is the difference between '@' and '=' in directive scope](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/14050195/angularjs-what-is-the-difference-between-and-in-directive-scope)

All I write down thest three demos.

1. `=` [Demo](https://jsbin.com/luguvun/edit?html,js,output)

2. `@` [Demo](https://jsbin.com/risozu/edit?html,js,output)

3. `&` [Demo](https://jsbin.com/gafago/edit?html,js,output)
