## [Why Do React Hooks Rely on Call Order?](https://overreacted.io/why-do-hooks-rely-on-call-order/)

文章就是在讲 `Why Do React Hooks Rely on Call Order`， 重点在比较几种对于 React 团队的 Hooks 提案的社区改进意见的问题（flaw）：

- Flaw #1: Can’t Extract a Custom Hook
- Flaw #2: Name Clashes
- Flaw #3: Can’t Call the Same Hook Twice
- Flaw #4: The Diamond Problem
- Flaw #5: Copy Paste Breaks Things
- Flaw #6: We Still Need a Linter
- Flaw #7: Can’t Pass Values Between Hooks
- Flaw #8: Too Much Ceremony

### 额外学到的知识

- [The diamond problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiple_inheritance#The_diamond_problem): The "diamond problem" (sometimes referred to as the "Deadly Diamond of Death") is an ambiguity that arises when two classes B and C inherit from A, and class D inherits from both B and C. If there is a method in A that B and C have overridden, and D does not override it, then which version of the method does D inherit: that of B, or that of C?
- [Mixins cause name clashes](https://reactjs.org/blog/2016/07/13/mixins-considered-harmful.html#mixins-cause-name-clashes)

## [React hooks: not magic, just arrays](https://medium.com/@ryardley/react-hooks-not-magic-just-arrays-cd4f1857236e)

很清晰，但是还是得看源码。

以上。
